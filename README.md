# Minishell (As beautiful as shell ☺️)

Minishell is a 42 school project. 

The main goal of this project is to simulate bash shell.

## Usage

```bash
Make
./minishell
```

## But what is implemented?
Minishell can be used to run bash commands (with or without pipe '|')

It can handle redirections such as '<'  '>'  '<<'  '>>'

It can also handle ctrl+c and ctrl+d keyboard input to interrupt and exit processes

It also has expansion feature such as echo "$USER" that will print /yarutiun or anything that can be expanded from env

It can expand echo "$?" and print the last exit code.
